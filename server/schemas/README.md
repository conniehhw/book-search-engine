# Book Search Engine

Link to Heroku site: [Not yet available](https://)

## Description

Purpose is to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The purpose is to evolve along with data changes and user demands.

## Installation

The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. To refactor - an Apollo Server and Provider was set up to use GraphQL, with modifications to the existing authentication middleware needed to function in this context. These changes allow for requests to be communicated with the Apollo server.
